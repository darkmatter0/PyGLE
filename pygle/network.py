    Parameters
    ----------
    onlymine : boolean, optional
        Search only for points first discovered by the current user. Use any

    first : int, optional
        (DEPRECATED: use searchAfter) Result offset to fetch, used to page through
        results. Defaults to 0. COMMAPI queries are bounded at 100 pages. If you 
        need more open-ended searches than this, we recommend contacting
        WiGLE-admin@wigle.net to discuss bulk pricing.
    latrange1 : float, optional
        Lesser of two latitudes by which to bound the search.
    latrange2 : float, optional
        Greater of two latitudes by which to bound the search.
    longrange1 : float, optional
        Lesser of two latitudes by which to bound the search.
    longrange2 : float, optional
        Greater of two longitudes by which to bound the search.
    lastupdt : str, optional
        Filter points by how recently they've been updated, condensed date/time
        numeric string format 'yyyyMMddhhmmss'
    freenet : boolean, optional

    paynet : boolean, optional
        Include only networks that have been marked as for-pay access.
    netid : str, optional
        Include only networks matching the string network BSSID, e.g. 
        '0A:2C:EF:3D:25:1B' or '0A:2C:EF'. The first three octets are required.
    ssid : str, optional
        Include only networks exactly matching the string network name.
    ssidlike : str, optional
        Include only networks matching the string network name, allowing
        wildcards '%' (any string) and '_' (any character).
    variance : float, optional
        How tightly to bound queries against the provided latitude/longitude
        box. Value must be between 0.001 and 0.2
    resultsPerPage : int, optional
        How many results to return per request. Defaults to 25 for COMMAPI, 10
        for site. Bounded at 1000 for COMMAPI, 100 for site.
    searchAFter : long, optional
        Previous page's search_after to get the next page. Use this instead of
